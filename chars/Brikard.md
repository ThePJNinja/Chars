### ABILITIES

#### Powers/Abilities:

- Tungsten Aura: He can form tungsten tools and weapons out of his aura.
- Soil Transmute: He can control 20m^3 of soil or stone at a time, telekinetically. This only works as long as he
  touches part of it.
	- He can use this to tunnel underground.
- Breathe life: He can cause plantlife to grow 10000x faster and 10x taller, whist controlling how it grows and in which
  direction.
- Multiple forms: Ember has two stronger forms they can swap to:
	- Honored (Up to 3 Hours):
		- Triple strength
		- No need to eat or sleep
		- Safe in the vacuum of space
		- Radiation resistance up to 20 Krads
- Holy (30 Mins):
	- Same as before
	- Double Honored form strength
- Counts as Emeralds:
	- This universe doesn't have Terra Emeralds, but if it did, It would work like Ember with the sol emeralds.

#### Weapons and Items:

- Can summon Tungsten weapons (above)

#### Strengths:

- Extremely calculated defense and hard to predict offense
- Pretty scary looking to those who don't know he's a big teddy bear.

#### Weaknesses:

- Putting lives on the line breaks Ember's scales of right/wrong.
- Their power comes directly from their own will, so mindgames are particularly effective at weakening them.
- Their transmutation technique can't be applied in quantities greater than their maximun aura released, so they aren't
  effective underwater or when someone keeps them wet constantly. Liquid water is more dense than steam, so it's more
  effective against them.
	- This is NOT true in holy form. All their fire techniques use nuclear fusion rather than chemical combustion in
	  that form, and therefore it's unaffected by water.

### BACKSTORY

Brikard comes from the same world as Ember and has the same amnesia.

His techniques involve his tungsten aura, which complements his immense strength

He's sticking with Big right now and seeing where things go. Fishing is new to him, and he's still learning!
