### PERSONALITY

He's stoic, but extraordinarily emotional. In combat, he makes a good leader because he keeps a level head and can think
fast. He can oftentimes put people off by his strange quietness and outwardly invisible interest.

``` ```

### ABILITIES

#### Powers/Abilities:

- Tungsten Aura: He can form tungsten tools and weapons out of his aura.
- Soil Transmute: He can control 20m^3 of soil or stone at a time, telekinetic. This only works as long as he
  touches part of it.
	- He can use this to tunnel underground.
- Breathe life: He can cause plant life to grow 10000x faster and 10x taller, whist controlling how it grows and in which
  direction.
- Multiple forms: Ember has two stronger forms they can swap to:
	- Honored (Up to 3 Hours):
		- Triple strength
		- No need to eat or sleep
		- Safe in the vacuum of space
		- Radiation resistance up to 20 Krads
- Holy (30 Mins):
	- Same as before
	- Double Honored form strength
- Counts as Emeralds:
	- This universe doesn't have Terra Emeralds, but if it did, It would work like Ember with the sol emeralds.

#### Weapons and Items:

- Can summon Tungsten weapons (above)

#### Strengths:

- Extremely calculated defense and hard to predict offense.
- Pretty scary looking to those who don't know he's a big teddy bear.

#### Weaknesses:

- They run through their abilities quite quickly. You'll see all they have in a matter of moments.
- His low accuracy and low stamina makes it so an agile foe able to dodge until he's exhausted.

### BACKSTORY

Brikard comes from the same world as Ember and has the same amnesia.

His techniques involve his tungsten aura, which complements his immense strength.

He's sticking with Big right now and seeing where things go. Fishing is new to him, and he's still learning!
