### PERSONALITY

They're a little naive, but not at all weak-willed. Ember oftentimes shows a greater care about the safety of complete strangers over their own. They suffer from the whole "Goku complex" of constantly wanting to fight stronger people. (It's not a universal saiyan thing, they wouldn't have gone nearly extinct if it was, super sayians would be plentiful.) Their smiles are infectious.

### ABILITIES

#### Powers/Abilities:

- Transmute Aura: Ember's aura is made of water vapor, so they transmute it into Hydrogen and Oxygen for their
  techniques. This can also be applied to some bodies of water
- 1-2-3 Punch: Ember punches outwards, then their aura creates a shockwave, then they detonate the aura. It creates a
  triple impact.
- Flame Absorption:
    - Ember can absorb open fires to recover stamina. It's the perfect fire extinguisher as well.
- Extreme Resistance to temperatures: Ember can't burn or freeze to death, but if they feel heat as strong as the sun's
  core, they'll be overwhelmed with its energy and eventually die, and if they feel cold near absolute zero, they'll
  eventually die of exhaustion.
- Radiation resistance up to 20 Krads
- Multiple forms: Ember has two stronger forms they can swap to:
    - Honored (Up to 3 Hours):
        - Triple strength
        - No need to eat or sleep
        - Safe in the vacuum of space
- Holy (30 Mins):
    - Same as before
        - Double Honored form strength
- Counts as Emeralds:
    - If they don't use any other skald techniques, they can count as 1-5 sol emeralds for the sake of helping others
      reach Burning (Like, Blaze's Burning form.)

#### Weapons and Items:

- 12mm handgun capable of being infused with the 1-2-3 punch technique (On its bullets). Uses less stamina than the
  regular version, but is weaker and has limited ammo.
- Dragonskin healing cloak

#### Strengths:

- Has a great unrelenting offence
- Most super-powered mobians will underestimate them because they have a handgun on them

#### Weaknesses:

- Putting lives on the line breaks Ember's scales of right/wrong.
- Their power comes directly from their own will, so mindgames are particularly effective at weakening them.
- Their transmutation technique can't be applied in quantities greater than their maximun aura released, so they aren't
  effective underwater or when someone keeps them wet constantly. Liquid water is more dense than steam, so it's more
  effective against them.
    - This is NOT true in holy form. All their fire techniques use nuclear fusion rather than chemical combustion in
      that form, and therefore it's unaffected by water.

### BACKSTORY

Ember comes from a world with very different systems for mobian special abilities. In that world, some mobians can
harness their own "Skald Techniques." Skald Techniques are fueled by personal willpower, and then exerted outwards as "
Aura."

Using poetry, mobians from Ember's world, Virmund, can do various things with their aura, depending on their
personality, and subconscious.

Aura is made out of different matter between different people. Only the most extreme change in character and personality
can change someone's aura, so people are usually stuck with what they get.

Ember has an aura made of water. As a sol user, this started out frustrating, but using a simple transmutation, Ember
learnt how to split it into Hydrogen and Oxygen gas, which is an explosive mixture.

Ember doesn't recall what happened that brought them to the sol dimension. They have old memories of their old world,
new memories of this new world, but none of how they travelled between.

Now they work with Blaze the Cat, both arriving in Sonic's Chaos Dimension upon learning that one of Ember's friends
arrived there...
