### BACKSTORY

Parallel to Sonic's Chaos dimension, is the Sol dimension. Blaze is the sol dimension's parallel to Sonic, and it even
has Nega, a parallel to Eggman.

Now there's a visitor in town. Ember showed up at the palace unannounced one day and challenged Blaze to a duel. Not to
take her throne, but just because they heard she was the strongest here. After initial unpleasentness, Blaze realized
how similar Ember was to Sonic, and they became fast friends. Blaze won the duel, by the way.

Cream told Her about Big's new friend once, and when the description matched one of Ember's colleagues, they were off to
the chaos dimension.
